# Printed parts  
All parts should be printed from PET-G or material with higher temperature resistance.  
PLA is not a good option. It has low glass transition temperature for power supply case, main frame, fluorometer and other parts.  

Smaller parts like Bottle - Cap, LED holders are designed for 0.4 mm nozzle.  
Bigger parts like motor mount, fluorometer are designed for 0.6 mm nozzle.  

Assembly of all part including hardware is in `Device_assembly.step`
